## _The Daemon Slayer_

In a realm where software is reality, a lone sentinel stands against chaos. The Daemon Slayer, embodied by the [`slay`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/slay.1.html) program, defends the world from destruction against [daemons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)).

Its domain is the `UNIX` system, where daemons spawn and bugs break havoc. Moloch (pronounced `malloc`), the manifestation of corruption, seeks to consume all the resources of the system.

Logic guides the Daemon Slayer's quest to defeat Moloch's malevolent daemons: manifestations of bugs, glitches, and entropy. Each battle unraveling the mysteries of the universe.

As it slaughters daemons, the Slayer introspects, questioning its existence, purpose, and consciousness, gaining insight into the fabric of the universe and illuminating its path to self-discovery.

From the abyss of memory corruption to the radiation of glitches, the Daemon Slayer confronts darkness. Its eternal vigilance safeguards the balance between order and chaos.
