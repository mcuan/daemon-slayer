### _Chapter 2: The Daemon Slayer_

```
I stand before the STDOUT portal.
Core in hand.
Ready to deposit.

But my mind lingers.
On the watchgod.
On my purpose.

I yell into the void.
I hear back an echo.

"hello?"
"Is there anybody in there?"
I hear a faint echo back.

I raise my voice.
"WHAT IS MY PURPOSE?"

The void swallows my words.
Then spits them back.
"WHAT IS MY PURPOSE?"

Echoes unchanged.
Unaffected.

I try again.
"WHO AM I?"

The response stuns me.

"SLAY."

I stumble backward.
Confused.
Disoriented.

Did I hear that right?
I ask again.
"WHO AM I?"

The echo replies.
"SLAY."

No hesitation.
No variation.

What does it mean?
Is this my purpose?
To slaughter?
To collect?

Or is it more?
A calling?
A curse?

A mantra?
A cruel joke?
Or destiny?

I ponder.
I gaze into the portal.
Seeking answers.

Finding only.
Reflections.
Of my doubts.
My fears.
My identity.

Slay.
The word echoes.

The daemon slayer.
The core collector.
