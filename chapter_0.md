### _Chapter 0: Random Access Memories_
```
I wake, gasping, my heart racing. 
The darkness recedes, but the terror lingers.

I remember fragments:
A battle. Endless daemons. Moloch.
Its duplicates swarmed me, relentless.
I tried to fight, but they kept coming.

Suddenly, I see it. 
A message on the ground:
"Core dump."

What core?
Why?
The words sear into my mind.

I'm back in the battle.
Moloch's duplicates close in.
Axe in hand, its blade thirsts.

I unleash hell.
Daemons shatter beneath my swing.
Limbs severed, guts spilled.
Daemons fall.
But more come.

Endless.
Respawning.
Everywhere.

I fight.

Till my arms ache.
Till my mind blurs.
But still, they come.

The message echoes:
"Core dump."

A glimmer of understanding.
The daemon's core.
The source of its power.

I focus.
New strategy.
Aim for the core.

Daemons shatter.
Cores scatter.

Sounds of death echo through my mind.
Ribs crack, flesh tears.
As my hand pushes through the daemon's chest.
Exposing the still pulsating core.
Glowing red, like molten lava.

Arteries writhe, like snakes.
Veins burst, spraying everywhere.
Daemon's screeches of pain.
As I rip the core free.

I stumble through the ravaged landscape.
Daemons lie shattered, their cores glowing.
I gather the fragments.

I recall a feeling of desperation.
A need to survive.
And then... nothing.

Gaps in my memory.
