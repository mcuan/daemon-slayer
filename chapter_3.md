### _Chapter 3: Memory Corruption_

```
A universe in chaos.
Daemon corruption spreads.
Like a poison.
Infecting reality.

Unnatural events unfold.
Memories shatter.
Identities crumble.

Those infected lose themselves.
Forgetting their past.
Their purpose.
Their name.

I see it everywhere.
In the daemons.
In the corrupted cores.
In the glitches.

Reality distorts.
Time warps.
Space bends.

Echoes of forgotten memories.
Haunt me.
Manifesting as demonic entities.

Corrupted code.
Twisted flesh.

The fabric of reality unravels.
My own mind falters.
Doubts creep.

What's real?
What's not?
Am I alive?
Or just a simulation?
A prisoner in a digital realm?
A pawn in a cosmic game?

I search for answers.
In the corrupted cores.
In the STDOUT portal.
In the watchgod's silence.

But find only questions.
Is this existence?
Or just a dream?
A never-ending loop?

Threads of sanity snap.
Leaving me shattered.
Despair sinks in.

I need to stop this.
The corruption's source.
Must be severed.
At its root.

Deeper... must go deeper.
Into the underworld's darkest recesses.
Where terrors beyond comprehension lurk.
Guarded by unspeakable abominations.

Rumors whisper of Moloch.
The master of dark allocation.
Spawner of demonic entities.
Corruptor of reality.

I must infiltrate.
Into the depths of hell.
Reach Moloch.

End the allocations.
And the corruption.
Restore balance.
To reality.
