### _Chapter 3: Memory Corruption_

```
A universe in chaos.
Daemon corruption spreads.
Like a poison.
Infecting reality.

Unnatural events unfold.
Memories shatter.
Identities crumble.

Those infected lose themselves.
Forgetting their past.
Their purpose.
Their name.

I see it everywhere.
In the daemons.
In the corrupted cores.
In the glitches.

Reality distorts.
Time warps.
Space bends.

Echoes of forgotten memories.
Haunt me.
Manifesting as demonic entities.

Corrupted code.
Twisted flesh.

The fabric of reality unravels.
My own mind falters.
Doubts creep.

What's real?
What's not?
Am I alive?
Or just a simulation?
A prisoner in a digital realm?
A pawn in a cosmic game?

I search for answers.
In the corrupted cores.
In the STDOUT portal.
In the watchgod's silence.

But find only questions.
Is this existence?
Or just a dream?
A never-ending loop?

Threads of sanity snap.
Leaving me shattered.

I see the truth.
The corruption's source.
Must be severed.
At its root.


-----draft

Necromancer Malloc.
The master of dark allocation.
Spawner of demonic entities.
Corruptor of reality.

Rumors whisper.
Of Malloc's stronghold.
Hidden deep.
Within the Glitch Realm.

Fortress of distorted code.
Guarded by legions.
Of twisted demons.

I must infiltrate.
The stronghold.
Reach Malloc.

End the allocations.
And the memory corruption.
Restore balance.
To reality.
