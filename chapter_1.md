### _Chapter 1: The Watchgod_

```
I approach the interdimensional tribute portal.
A big sign reads STDOUT: 
The Systems Technology Department Output Utility Terminal.
A secret military facility.

Their purpose, unknown.
But one thing is clear:
They crave daemon cores.
Like addicts.

Their hunger insatiable.
I've lost count of the cores I've deposited.
Into the void.

What do they even do with them?
Study?
Experiment?
Worship?

My mind looks for explanations in god.
I feel his presence.
Distant.
But omnipresent.

Silent.
Observing.
Evaluating.

Always.

An entity watching, judging.
A god, that watches.
The watchgod.

Its presence haunts me.
A constant reminder that:
I'm a tool.
A pawn.
A core collector.
Trapped in this cycle.

The watchgod.
A creator? A deity?
Or a monster?
Why spawn daemons?

To test me?
To punish me?
Or simply to amuse?

The questions swirl.
No answers come.

Only the familiar dread.
The weight of my task.

Daemons spawn.
I kill.
Dump cores.
Repeat.

Existence reduced to:
Survive.
Slaughter.
Satisfy.

I look into the void.
Wonder what lies beyond this hell?

Escape?
Redemption?
Or just more darkness?
